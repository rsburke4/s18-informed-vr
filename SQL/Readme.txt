Before running! SQL script will delete all existing data in the table.

This script builds the tables used in the database. (And was originally designed to insert into the database too, but I believe that is included in the parsing application now. Ideally, the parsing app will also contain the create table script too.) Anyway: Run the script by navigating to the directory where all files are located before launching MySQL. Then use "SOURCE Build.txt" to build the tables.

Remember. Don't run this if the data already exists and you value it. You'll ruin everything. Everything. Eeeeevvveeerryyyythiiiiinnnngggg.
